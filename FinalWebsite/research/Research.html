 <h1> Connections Between Bluetooth Use and Mental Degradation</h1>
    
<p>
    Bluetooth device usage may also have psychological ramifications. The constant connectivity offered by Bluetooth technology can contribute to anxiety and stress. A survey conducted by the Journal of Psychological Studies indicated that individuals who frequently use Bluetooth devices report higher levels of anxiety, largely attributed to the pressures of perpetual accessibility. This phenomenon, termed "connectivity anxiety," can lead to decreased mental well-being and impaired social interactions. This was a pattern supported by our research. The research conducted by Myriad Labs took a survey of high school and college students in which they found a directly proportional relationship between daily Bluetooth headphone use AUDIO DOWNLOAD 3 and lower IQ scores. This study used high school and college-age participants who use Bluetooth devices (speakers, AirPods, etc…). These students were set aside from a control group that did not use Bluetooth devices.
