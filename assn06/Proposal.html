      <h1>AudioMed: Uncovering the Truth Behind Bluetooth</h1>
<p> 
      For my topic, the fictitious truth I will be exploring is the dangers of Bluetooth and how it affects the health of the mind and body. My website will prove the unsavory truth behind Bluetooth's negative effect on bodily health. This website will be run by the corporation AudioMed and includes persuasive research, testimonials, and more. The website will be designed in a sleek minimal style synonymous with corporate design. The website will consist of a variety of information including dedicated pages for; research, a mission statement, a newsletter, and a store to buy non-Bluetooth audio devices. 
The fictitious organization behind my website is called AudioMed. AudioMed is a corporation that makes wired audio products such as wired speakers and headphones. This corporation seeks to spread information on the dangers Bluetooth can have on the body and brain. Not surprisingly, their messages also recommend using speakers and headphones that use auxiliary cords instead of Bluetooth.  Their hidden interest is to eliminate Bluetooth headphones and speakers from the market to create an economic monopoly. 
I will model the logo and other design elements for AudioMed by looking at some of the largest companies making audio equipment: Audio Technica, Bose, JBL, Beats Electronics, and more. Across all of these companies’ websites, there are common factors; bright pops of color on a white background, minimalist layout, modern San serif typography, and a concentration on high-end visual assets.  The main difference my website will have from these major audio equipment retailers is that AudioMed is also meant to give the impression that it also has a foot in the healthcare industry, working with Hospitals and Universities across the country to conduct its research. Therefore, less focus will be dedicated to getting the user to buy products. First, the user will be led to pages with academic research to give the website an heir of authority. This choice is aimed at gaining the user's trust hopefully making them more likely to make a purchase. 
The website will hold a range of information on the topic of Bluetooth and ways for the user to interact with this community. On the landing page will be the mission statement along with the logo and other key information about AudioMed. There will be a page dedicated to medical studies proving Bluetooth is malignant.  An example of one such study would be a survey of high school and college students in which they found a directly proportional relationship between daily Bluetooth headphone use and lower IQ scores. There will be another page dedicated to testimonials of those who stopped using Bluetooth products and a newsletter to stay updated with others in the community. Finally, there will be a page where users can buy audio devices that do not use Bluetooth. The navigational flow of the website will be smooth and each page will be designed using coordianted color schemes and font choices. 
Although AudioMed does have an ulterior motive for its research into the risks of Bluetooth, there could also be a perceived ‘benevolent truth’ in its message. Using Bluetooth reduces the device's battery and increases speed. Even having Bluetooth enabled on your phone can drain its battery faster. The benevolent truth behind this project is that Bluetooth, although not proven to cause bodily harm, does decrease the battery of one's device. So, by not using Bluetooth as frequently or at all, the user may experience an increase in battery life. 
My website is meant to address the fictitious truth that Bluetooth has adverse effects on the mind and body. This information is being distributed through AudioMed, a corporation that funds research into Bluetooth technologies while simultaneously being a large distributor of wired audio equipment. AudioMed’s funding of research is in efforts to get Bluetooth banned, giving it a monopoly on the market. Although this plan sounds sinister, the benevolent untruth behind their phony research is that using Bluetooth less of the time or not at all can help save battery life on one’s personal devices. </p>
