  <p>  My name is Shiva, I am a multidisciplinary artist and musician from Chicago. To be more specific, most of my work is centered around graphic design paired with traditional illustration and collage. I work in digital and analog formats to make logos, prints, clothing designs, and cover art.  In addition to this, I have always had a passion for music. The music I make now could be categorized as alternative rap but Iâ€™ll try to be more descriptive. I take inspiration from 90s Hip-Hop while trying to put a more modern twist on the production and lyrics. My work takes inspiration from the intersection of artistic expressions in Chicago, from graffiti on the rooftops to classical installations at the Art Institute. With my creative work, I want to fuse illustration, typography, collage, and photo manipulation to create compositions that best reflect me. </P>
