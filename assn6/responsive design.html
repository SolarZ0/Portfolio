    <p> “Every so often, you hear a new recording by an artist you’ve been following for a period of time who’s breaking new ground. </p>

    <p>It feels odd to hear the work at first. It seems unfamiliar. You have no context for it. You may not be sure you like it. You may even reject it.</p> 
    
<p>Still, you’re compelled to listen again and again. A new pattern begins to emerge from your brain. What was strange becomes a little more familiar. You start to see how it connects to what came before. It begins to click in your mind, whether you like it or not.” 
</p>

    <p> In this quote, Rick Rubin elaborates on the ideas of comfortability and status quo in art. These ideas stretch beyond the boundaries of music. Rubin is trying to convey that consumers of art become comfortable receiving the same or similar artistic ideas. These ideas or methods may be drawn from the past or present movements in art, or they may just be a continuation of ideas already explored by the artist. This formulaic approach to art, though many might not like to hear it, is what the average consumer wants. 
</p>
    <p> However, the second point Rubin is making in this quote is that this formulaic approach can become static. If an artist continues to make work with themes that have succeeded in the past, this may hold them back from experimenting. And similarly, if an artist already has an established look or sound to their work, this can box them in leading to less success diversifying. Although experimenting and breaking from the norm can lead to more harsh critique, it is crucial for the development of new ideas and movements.
